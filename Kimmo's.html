<h1 style="color: white; font-family: 'Arial'; text-align: center; font-size: 40px;">Hey Kimmo, welcome to our first website
	<div> 
		<div style="font-size: 15px;">
		(yours because it's yours and mine because it's the first one i'm going to finish - and i'm gonna finish it)

<br>
<br>
<p>Okay, here we go...</p>
<br>
<p>Okay so I’ll first start with how I did not expect to be hit so hard by your leaving, <br> I mean I should have (I am the queen of delayed reactions after all) but I had rationalised this a thousand times after we found out.  
<br>
<br>
Side note: brains are not all they are cut out to be, man. 
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have spent the first week of your absence feeling a little detached from everything and after tons of introspection, <br> overthinking and just a lot of mess - I remembered what you said when Ludolf left, <br> that it never really feels like they are gone in the beginning because your brain (again, this organ is a mess) is telling you they’re on leave. <br> I think that’s what I have been going through this week. It mostly sucked BUT I also got the idea to dedicate a webpage to you. 
<br>
<br>
(selfishly because it’s a challenge for me - then because it’s a new PAGE for you..get it? <br> 
Sorry to disturb your laughing at my amazing joke but I just want to say Bron had a lot to do with the success of this page and wow, what a human, right?)
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I must say, I have been glad I get to keep you as a friend forever since after meeting you - because you had no choice but i’m gladder now. <br> The comforting thing about all this has been the thought that I can just call you up whenever I please and that’s that. <br> Aaaaand (this is not a grammatically correct sentence but) aaaaand, I can come over when we’re not being held hostage by a virus.
<br>
<br>
Kimm, you’re such an awesome person. You’re the kindest person I have ever come across (besides Amanda) you have such a gentle approach to living and <br> I really always want the world to treat you with the same gentleness. <br> You obviously can’t help it because if it were up to you, you would control everything <br> - yes, this is a jab at your control issues because i’m in the same boat so I feel that’s good enough - anyway, what shines through you is pure kindness and a soft approach. <br> I am glad more people get to experience you as a person, <br> I have been since I realised your Christian journey included group socialising. <br> it’s mostly because I have learned so much just from having you (and Bronno - special shout because again, what a human) in my life. I will be grateful forever and extend it - when I want. 
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm in a puddle of my tears now so I am ending this soon <br> but I just want you to know that you made my first working experience a dream. <br>Watching you bake a baby and just navigate life with Franco snr by your side is heartwarming and I wish you the best, <br> I wish you could also see yourself with our eyes as your friends. There are many eyes but they see pretty much the same beautiful thing I believe. 
<br>
What am I forgetting…
<br>
Uhm oh yes! Adidas will always be better for the culture and Nike for sports. <br> I will spend my whole life debating this with you and I look forward to your face crunching in disgust. <br> I love you, friend. Trust yourself and let loose because you’re about as good as they come. I am eternally grateful to God for you. Yea, i’m done now.
<br>
<br>
Side again: If you come across any typos or grammar errors, ignore them. I did this in one go and with no practice. 
<br>
<br>
Again, I love you, sis.
